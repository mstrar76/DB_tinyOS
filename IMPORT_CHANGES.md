# Import Statement Changes

This document describes the changes made to import statements after reorganizing the project's directory structure.

## Overview

After reorganizing the project files into a more logical directory structure, we needed to update import statements to ensure all modules could still find their dependencies. The main changes involved:

1. Creating proper Python packages with `__init__.py` files
2. Updating relative imports to use the new package structure
3. Testing to ensure all imports work correctly

## Package Structure

We created the following package structure:

```
src/
├── __init__.py
├── extraction/
│   └── __init__.py
├── processing/
│   └── __init__.py
├── utilities/
│   └── __init__.py
├── auth/
│   └── __init__.py
└── old/
    └── __init__.py
```

These `__init__.py` files allow Python to recognize each directory as a proper package.

## Import Changes

### Common Changes

The most common change was updating imports from the `db_utils` module, which was moved to the `utilities` directory:

**Before:**
```python
from db_utils import get_db_connection, close_db_connection
```

**After:**
```python
from src.utilities.db_utils import get_db_connection, close_db_connection
```

### Processing Module Imports

Similarly, imports from processing modules were updated:

**Before:**
```python
from process_data_with_tags import process_order_data
```

**After:**
```python
from src.processing.process_data_with_tags import process_order_data
```

## Files Updated

A total of 22 files were updated with new import statements:

### Extraction Scripts
- `fetch_all_orders_with_markers.py`
- `fetch_2024_2025_pending_orders.py`
- `fetch_pending_and_recent_orders.py`

### Processing Scripts
- `process_data_with_tags.py`
- `process_data.py`
- `update_orders_with_tags.py`
- `update_orders_2024_2025.py`
- `verificar_ordens_sem_contato.py`
- `verificar_ordens_tiny.py`
- `process_data_with_tags_old.py`

### Utility Scripts
- `create_chat_tables.py`
- `index_chat_files_jan2025.py`
- `index_chat_files.py`
- `sync_contacts_from_tiny.py`

### Old Scripts
- `fetch_historical_orders_2014_2016.py`
- `fetch_historical_orders_2016_2019.py`
- `save_special_orders_to_db.py`
- `fetch_historical_orders.py`
- `fetch_missing_orders_march_2024.py`

## Testing Import Changes

A test script (`test_imports.py`) was created to verify that the import changes work correctly. This script tests importing key modules from each package directory:

```python
# Test importing from utilities
from src.utilities.db_utils import get_db_connection, close_db_connection

# Test importing from processing
from src.processing.process_data_with_tags import process_order_data

# Test importing from extraction
from src.extraction.fetch_all_orders_with_markers import fetch_and_process_orders_for_period
```

All imports passed the test, confirming that the reorganization and import updates were successful.

## Future Considerations

When creating new Python files in the project, follow these guidelines:

1. Place the file in the appropriate directory based on its purpose:
   - Data extraction scripts go in `src/extraction/`
   - Data processing scripts go in `src/processing/`
   - Utility functions go in `src/utilities/`
   - Authentication code goes in `src/auth/`

2. Use the package structure for imports:
   ```python
   from src.utilities.db_utils import get_db_connection
   from src.processing.process_data import process_order_data
   ```

3. Run the test script periodically to ensure imports continue to work correctly:
   ```bash
   python test_imports.py
   ```
